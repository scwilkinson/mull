Thanks for checking out Mull!!!

The schematics and for all the modules are available in the repository, and the .brd files will be added over time.
At the moment the schematics are in .png format, but they will be uploaded as .sch files some time in the future.
These modules are totally powered through the headphone jack of a smartphone, or other device with a trrs jack.
In the Base folder are the schematics for creating your own Mull sensor modules, they have the power and signal circuitry
for communication with a phone on them, but there are no external sensors. The code uses the Soft-Modem library for
arduino, which is not yet compatible with arduino 1.0 or higher.

Thanks to:

Jonathan C. Hall, arms22, Adafruit Industries, Sparkfun Electronics for all of their exellent documentation.
